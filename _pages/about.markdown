**Watery** is a minimalist, bare-bones theme for the popular JAMstack file-based CMS Jekyll that only uses the `<80kb` [**Water.css** framework](https://github.com/kognise/water.css) (hence the name!), while still following the best practices possible for accessibility and search-engine optimization.

I created this because I wasn't able to find an up-to-date starter/skeleton theme for Jekyll. Even the default theme, Minima, uses the large Bootstrap framework.

This project is aimed towards those curious about using Jekyll for the first time, and want to build from as close to scratch as possible. Alternatively, it still has all the features required for creating a hassle-free, informational website or blog in just a few clicks.

As of November 1st, 2020, with over 100 posts on Watery, the website scores a perfect 100 in Performance, Accessibility, Best Practices, and SEO on an audit with [**Google Lighthouse**](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse).

### Features

Despite Watery's minimalist nature, there are a few interesting features that have been added:

- A fully customizable and empty `_BLANK_config.yml` to make getting up-and-running easy.
- Having a `_pages` collection for easier organization.
- Auto-generated links to newly created pages in the navigation.
- An author bio at the end of each post. (Located in `_inclues/author.html`)
- Full Rouge support for syntax highlighting. (Currently using `base16.solarized.light`)
- Auto-generated RSS feed, sitemap, accessibility features, and search-engine optimization.
